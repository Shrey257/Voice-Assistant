Today, I will be presenting a voice-controlled assistant that can interact with users, manage tasks, provide information, tell jokes, and perform various actions based on voice commands.

Voice Interaction: The assistant listens to user input via a microphone and responds with speech.
Command Processing: The assistant can understand and perform commands like:
  Searching Wikipedia.
  Opening websites (e.g., YouTube, Google).
  Adding and removing tasks from a schedule.
  Providing weather updates (requires an API).
  Performing mathematical calculations.
  Telling jokes, fun facts, and motivational quotes.
Customizable Features: You can add or remove actions and even extend the assistant's capabilities in the future.
